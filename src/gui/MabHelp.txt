This is the help document of our training "AdaBoosting with Java implementation".

Here are the explanation of settings.

--Data set information
Training data: The training data filename (arff file). Please use Browse to
  select. While selecting a new file, respective settings for our 
  experimentation will be filled. You can adjust them further.
Testing data: Can be ignored for "Split in two" and "Use training set" schemes.
Training/testing scheme: three typical schemes are provided.
Training fraction: Only valid for the "Split in two" scheme.
Number of base classifiers: Typically more than 100.
Stop after converge: When the training accuracy is very close to 1, the training
  process can be terminated.

--Tracking and output
Process tracking: Track the process in the console.
Variable tracking: Track variables for detailed debugging.
Output to file: Output the results to a file in the "results" folder. Attention: 
  It is not implemented here yet!

--Repeat times: How many time the experiment repeats.
